<p>It seems I might be addicted to building my own site. It's just so fun! All times I'm not preoccupied with something (i.e. these notes) I'm thinking how I could improve the site. But I can't really add any more untill my teach gets the new chips, as program mem is at 81% usage as of writing this. </p> 
<p>But still, I just want to keep adding! Add more cool tricks (I want it to be a tech demo too), add more cat photos, add more of these notes, etc. </p> 
<p>I do love a good challenge, and this fits the bill perfectly. It's tough, but not impossible. Slowly but surely squashing each bug and error is hard, but has an amazing feeling when the site you have been building for 6+ days suddenly works.</p>
<p>Thank you Cheshire for making that tutorial (he's the one who made the layout), thank you randos of the internet for having the same problem 3 years ago (that's how I found out about ESPAsyncWebServer, LittleFS, that one image file compressor, etc.), thank you Mr. Reive for allowing me to use the laptop I made this site on, as well as the ESP32-S2 it is currently running on.</p>
