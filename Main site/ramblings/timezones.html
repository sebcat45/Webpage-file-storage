<p>timezone differences are always kinda funny to me. for example, one of the webcomics I read was updated at 4:02 AM, yet it's 2:37. can you guess why I can read it anyways? correct; the site's time zone said it was uploaded at 4.</p> 
<p>sometimes it's hella annoying. wanted to call your friend? can't, it's midnight. wanted to play a new pre-alpha multiplayer game? sorry, your time zone is different than the devs, causing a desync. or, all the sweats come online <i>right</i> when you get off work</p>
