<p>Weirdly, my brain works best when I am either standing in the shower, or typing at night. I guess because all of my other senses are filled with noise, therefore my subconscious filters them out, giving my brain more power to think.<br> 
<i>after all, I did make most of this webpage at 1-4 am.</i> </p> 

<p>Meanwhile my brain's langauge and thought processing fight for power during the day, causing a<br> 
"*bla bla bla*in this you......uh.........will end up*bla bla*"<br> 
To happen as my brain scrables to both pull up the required info <i>and</i> talk at the same time</p>

<p>This can be especially bad if me and my team are in a "all hands on deck" sisituation in some online game like SoT and my brain decides to not talk. I am still firing the cannons, but I'm failing to do callouts.</p>
