<p>It's wild how unnerving the original music for pallet town was. People were literally getting nightmares from it, man!</p> 
<p>Because of said complaints the big N changed it, just by lowering some notes. It went from creepy 8-bit horror music to normal town music. </p> 
<p>If you watch any spooky video about pokemon it will most likely be using the original, no wonder you get an unsettling feeling when watching!</p>
