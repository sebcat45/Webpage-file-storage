I found this video about a lost song.<br>
After watching it, youtube recommended the reupload of it. I put it on the Watch Later and forgot about it.<br>
But youtube kept recommending it.<br>
Eventually, at 1:00 AM, I opened it. And listened.<br>
After a while I downloaded it, put it on loop, and began reading. <br>
I was getting goosebumps, not being able to focus.<br>
I shut down the wifi, data, location, sounds, and just sat.</p>
<p>Just sitting there, staring at the void, my headset's light pinging and my battery's dim glow, absorbed in this song, various thoughts floating in my skull.</p>
<p>the song looped. and looped. and looped.<br>
the perfect thought floated past: write.<br>
and so I did<br>
even whilst writing this I was still getting goosebumps.</p>
