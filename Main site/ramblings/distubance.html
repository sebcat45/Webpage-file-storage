                <p>It is implied in the song DISTURBANCE of the FnF mod "The Disk Origins" that Sonic (not the .exe, just the normal one) has delved too far into the internet, and now is scarred by what it has to offer.</p>
                <p>This may not be very clear (after all, why is Sonic fighting Vaporeon?), but the v2 clears it up by adding a 4chan background to Vaporeon, showing that he most likely came upon the post about how Vaporeon are so good at... human intercourse.</p>
                <p>This is further solidified by how the Vaporeon is blushing (or just has rosy cheeks) and has a... more human-shaped body and chest.</p>

                <p>If you really want the 4chan post, you will just have to do with Reddit. As an upside, you now have the full thesis:<br>
